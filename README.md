# Customer Segmentation & Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System using machine learning techniques. It involves analyzing customer data, performing clustering to segment customers, and utilizing these segments for targeted recommendations.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and normalizes data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Implements K-Means clustering to group similar customers.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses Silhouette Score to assess clustering effectiveness.
- **Recommendation System**: Provides personalized recommendations based on customer segments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (K-Means, PCA, StandardScaler)

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Place the dataset (`data.csv`) in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step.
4. Analyze the customer segmentation results and utilize the recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain relevant customer information such as:
- Purchase history
- Demographic details
- Behavioral data

## Results & Insights
- Identifies key customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.
- Provides a data-driven approach to customer recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating more advanced clustering techniques (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Implementing a collaborative filtering-based recommendation model.
- Enhancing data visualization for better interpretability.
